# Excercise 8: Next Steps

++TODO REWORD THIS++

Now that you have this working... 


- Load the code to record gestures. Create more CSV files with gestures. Retrain the model. Load the new model back onto the Arduino.
  - Note: you'll need to edit the code to add the names of the new geture files

- Try increasing and decreasing the amount of recordings per gesture, how does this impact performance?

- Tweak the model structure and parameters
  - Can you get better results?
  - Can you reduce the size and still get "good" results

- Try quantizaton to reducce the model size and/or avoid floating point math: https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization

- Grab a board and the TinyML book to continue at home
