# Classifying IMU Data

1. Download the https://github.com/sandeepmistry/aimldevfest-workshop-2019/blob/master/ArduinoSketches/IMU_Classifier/IMU_Classifier.ino sketch
1. Create a new tab named model.h, and place the model.h generated in the previous code cell inside it.
1. Upload the sketch
1. Open the Serial Monitor: Tools -> Serial Monitor
1. Press the button, and perform a gesture
1. The confidence of each gesture will be printed to the Serial Monitor (0 -> low confidence, 1 -> high confidence)

NOTE: model.h is generated in colab, they need to download it
